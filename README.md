# request-transformer-foo
Kong plugin to add data from other service (http GET), into the original request before sending it upstream. (Probably a bad idea)


# TODO
- [ ] read plugin dev tutorial
  - [ ] setup kong dev environment
- [ ] see if this can be a fork of https://github.com/Kong/kong-plugin-request-transformer
- [ ] insert some data from an http get into the headers
  - maybe something from [this JSON](https://api.github.com/users/fczuardi)
- [ ] discard everything, or change the lame name of this project
